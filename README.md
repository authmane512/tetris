Hello!

This project is simple implementation of the Tetris famous game. 
I've made it mainly for learning purpose. I don't think that you
will find pleasure playing with it, but if you are developer, you
can read the source code which is documented. Hope that it'll allow
you to learn things.

You can access to the documentation here:
https://authmane512.github.io/tetris/html/files.html

To install this program on Linux, first download it:
```
git clone https://github.com/authmane512/tetris.git
cd tetris
```

Before compile it, you need SDL2 library which you can install like that on Debian:
```
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
```

Then you can compile the code:
```
make
```

Finally start the program:
```
./tetris
```
